# flutter_hook_try_out

A new Flutter project.

## TODO

- Trying flutter hook in [simple state management](#simple-state-management) (Counter App)
- Tyring flutter hook in medium state management (Todo App)
- Integrate flutter hook with other state management (Provider, Riverpod, GetX)
- Make a docs about the journey.

## Simple state management

Create a simple state management with counter app
> lib/counter_app/counter_app.dart

- Simply increase the state on tap and update the rendering real time
- React like hook, reduce time to write life cycle function
